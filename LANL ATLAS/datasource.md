Data sources from supercomputers and HPC applications.
Data from supercomputers play a fundamental role in academic and applied research and development.  Understanding this, LANL's High Performance Computing and USRC work to release data as possible within security and proprietary limitations.

1995–2005 Reliability/Interrupt/Failure/Usage Data Sets
NOTE: These data are historical in nature and were originally released in 2005.

In order to enable open computer science research, access to computer operational data is desperately needed. Data in the areas of failure, availability, usage, environment, performance, and workload characterization are some of the most desperately needed by computer science researchers. The following sets of data are provided under universal release to any computer science researcher to use to enable computer science work.

 

All we ask is that if you use these data in your research, please recognize Los Alamos National Laboratory for providing these data. 

All files and content available for download are covered by LA-URs listed in the filename. Each file is a tar.gz archive with a data file (either CSV or text file) and a README with some explanations.
